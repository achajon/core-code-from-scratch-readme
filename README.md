# Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages

A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

❓Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both ❔

Yes, a java program is first compiled into bytecode which JRE can understand. ByteCode is then interpreted by the JVM making it as interpreted language.
